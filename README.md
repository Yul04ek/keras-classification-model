#  Handwritten Digit Classification Using Keras



This project demonstrates how to build a simple neural network to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the TensorFlow/Keras library.



##  Description



The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 images for training and 10,000 for testing.
A fully connected neural network with Dropout and L2 regularization is used.
